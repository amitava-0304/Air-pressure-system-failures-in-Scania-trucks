# Air-pressure-system-failures-in-Scania-trucks
The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.
# Introduction
The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
# The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. The test set contains 16000 examples.
# Number of Attributes: 171
